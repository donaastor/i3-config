# i3-config
If you want to use this code:<br>
First, don't because it is a very specific thing made to work with my own system configuration.<br>
If you are still determined then fine:<br>
Ok, so this code is copied from this project: https://github.com/grwlf/xkb-switch. The original code is lincenced under GPL-3 licence. I only deleted some lines from the original code and modified the main() function. So, the main() function is all mine, but I did reuse some of the original ideas in it too. I suppose I described how I altered this code and thus fulfilled my legal duties.
