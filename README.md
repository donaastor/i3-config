Ok, so I've got no idea about legal stuff - not my profession, not my way to improve the world -> not important. Still, I'd like to note how appreciative I am of the fact that the authors of the original project (this one: https://github.com/grwlf/xkb-switch) were generous enough to put that very nice licence on the project. I copied half of the code from it and modified to suit my needs. I thank them for that. Thus I want to (and legally should I guess) be the same kind of author and allow anyone to do whatever they want with my code and improve the world with it however they can. All the best
