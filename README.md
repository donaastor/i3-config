# i3-config
If you want to use this code:<br>
First, don't because it is a very specific thing made to work with my own system configuration.<br>
If you are still determined then fine:<br>
Ok, so this code is copied from this project: https://github.com/grwlf/xkb-switch/blob/master/src/XKeyboard.cpp. The original code is lincenced under GPL-3 licence. I only deleted some lines from the original code and modified the main() function. So, the main() function is all mine, but I did reuse some of the original ideas in it too. I suppose I described how I altered this code and thus fulfilled my legal duties. If the lawyers are not satisfied then here is an oracle that results in exact differences in linear fashion: Remove all blank characters from both mine and original code, pick an instruction from my code then use KMP algorithm to find it in the original code then remove everything to that point from the original code. Do it for every instruction in my code. Ultimately, if you allow the oracle to acces a Linux machine, let it call diff on my code and the original code. That is how to get yourself a nice description of all the changes.
